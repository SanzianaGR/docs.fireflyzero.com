To establish a multiplayer connection, take 2 or more devices (or launch 2 or more copies of the emulator) and on each device:

1. Open the launcher.
1. Press `menu` (`Tab` on the emulator).
1. Go down to the "Start multiplayer" button.
1. Press `A` (`Enter` on the emulator).
1. Wait for all other devices to appear on the list.
1. Press `A` to stop scanning.
1. Press `A` to confirm that the list of devices is complete.

Then on any of the devices select and launch the app you want to play together. That's it! The app should start on all devices and you all should have control.
